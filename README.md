# izzi

These are C++ sources designed to produce images from a subset of the
SVG standard, using a header-only library. It is generally useful for
graphing, cartography, generative design, and data-intensive
computational expression.


**PREREQUISITES**

Development and use is hosted on top-of-tree Linux. At the moment,
this means Fedora 33 or Centos 8 operating systems on multi-core
x86_64 hardware.

Some familiarity with Linux, GNU coding styles, C++17-20, and the SVG standard are assumed.
