# izzi

These are C++ sources designed produce a subset of the SVG standard,
designed to be a header-only library useful for graphing, cartography,
generative design, and data-intensive computational expression.


**PREREQUISITES**

Development and use is hosted on top-of-tree Linux. At the moment,
this means Fedora 33 or Centos 8 operating systems on multi-core
x86_64 hardware.

Some familiarity with Linux, GNU coding styles, C++17, and the SVG standard are assumed.
